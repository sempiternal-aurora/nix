Pick a nice cursor theme - See if dracula colours?
check for remaining configs to be ported
ssh needs to be integrated somehow - maybe 1password ssh keys
Zen config
Something else I'm forgetting
once you're sure there's nothing more to port in, nuke home directory, needs cleaning
 - Make sure all git repos are pushed beforehand
